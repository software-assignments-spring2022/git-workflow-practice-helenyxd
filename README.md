# GameDev.net

## What is it?

[GameDev.net](gamedev.net) is a website for game developers and people who are otherwise interested in news surrounding game development to view blogs, forums, news, and even careers conveniently in the same space. Additionally, the website also offers a place for people to show off their projects and access tutorials, streamlining the procesSs of both learning how to develop their own projects, and also market and test them. 

## Why is it interesting?

As someone who is currently learning how to use development engines to create video games, this website is particularly interesting to me. While engines such as Unity do have their own learning tutorials and community forums, those spaces are focused only on learning about and using the engine. GameDev.net offers an easy way to keep up with recent news in the community and to find (or post your own) devlogs on games that people are in the process of making. It's interesting to see what other people are working on and the journeys that they have been on, and to hear from professionals in the industry on how they got where they are. In this way, GameDev.net is unique.

It is a good website for game developer. I think the forum in this website could be extremely helpful for those who are interested in game designing or are learning these. Game designer definitely learn more while exchanging different ideas, technologies and frameworks. You can also ask question and answer others' question in GameDev.net.

I think that's a great website! It makes it easier for people interested in news surrounding game development to view blogs, forums, news, etc to find a space just for them without having to go to reddit or other places. It will be interesting to see how many game ideas can come from people being able to learn from each other and discuss things on GameDev.net
